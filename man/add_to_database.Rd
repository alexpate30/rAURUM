\description{
Add the raw data from one of the CPRD flatfiles to an SQLite database.
}
\details{
Will add the file to a table named \code{filetype} in the SQLite database, unless \code{tablename} is specified.

If \code{use.set = FALSE}, then \code{subset.patids} should be a vector of patid's that the .txt files will be subsetted on before adding to the SQLite database.
If \code{use.set = TRUE}, then \code{subset.patids} should be a dataframe with two columns, \code{patid} and \code{set}, where \code{set} corresponds to the number in the filename
following the word 'set'. This functionality is provided to increase computational efficiency when subsetting to a cohort of patients which is very large (millions).
This can be a computationally expensive process as each flatfile being read in, must be cross matched with a large vector .
The CPRD flatfiles are split up into groups which can be identified from their naming convention. Patients from set 1, will have their data
in DrugIssue, Observation, etc, all with the same "set" suffix in the flatfile name. We can utilise this to speed up the process of subsetting
the data from the flatfiles to only those with patids in subset.patid. Instead we subset to those with patids in subset.patids, and with the
corresponding value of "set", which matches the suffix "set" in the CPRD flatfile filename. For example, patients in the Patient file which had
suffix "set1", will have their medical data in the Observation file with suffix "set1". When subsetting the Observation file to those in
subset.patids (our cohort), we only need to do so for patients who were also in the patient file with suffix "set1".
If the cohort of patients for which you want to subset the data to is very small, the computational gains from this argument are minor and it
can be ignored.

The function for reading in the .txt file will be chosen from a set of functions provided with rAURUM, based on  the fletype (\code{filetype}).
\code{extract.txt.func} does not need to be specified unless wanting to manually define the function for doing this. This may be beneficial if wanting to
change variable formats, or if the variables in the .txt files change in future releases of CPRD AURUM.
