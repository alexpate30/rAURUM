Description: rAURUM simplifies the process of converting raw CPRD Aurum data, stored in large .txt files, 
  into an 'analysis-ready' dataset which can be used for statistical analyses. 
  This process is somewhat difficult in R, as the raw data is very large and cannot be read into the R workspace. 
  rAURUM utilises RSQLite to create SQLite databases which are stored on the hard disk. 
  These are then queried to extract the required information for a cohort of interest. 
  The processes follow closely that from the rEHR package, see Springate et al., (2017) 
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0171784> which was designed for extractin CPRD GOLD data, and is no longer available on CRAN.
